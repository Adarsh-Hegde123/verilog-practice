# Verilog Practice

This repository contains my Verilog practice codes. Each folder has a separate module along with its testbench, waveform, and basic explanation.

## Folder List

- `LFSR_5bit` - 5-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register

## Tools Used

- **Vivado 2018.2** – for simulation, synthesis, and waveform generation
- **Verilog HDL** – hardware description language

## Purpose

This repository is for learning and improving Verilog coding skills. It includes small projects that help understand digital design concepts like flip-flops, counters, shift registers, and FSMs.

## How to Use

1. Go into any module folder
2. Open the `.v` files (main module and testbench)
3. Simulate using Icarus Verilog or any other simulator
4. View waveforms with GTKWave

## To Do (Upcoming Modules)

- ALU
- BCD Counter
- Finite State Machine
- UART
